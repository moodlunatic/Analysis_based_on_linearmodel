The Dwarf Squeaker (Arthroleptis xenodactyloides) is a species of frog in the Arthroleptidae family
which lives in cloud forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Africa. The size of the frog is quite small
which is just about the size of a human fingernail. They can thrive in many habitats such as lowland
montane forests and are believed to be a generalist. With accelerating deforestation and increasing
critical forest habitat destruction, the frogs are facing habitat loss. Understanding the ecology of
the frogs is important for protecting their survival. We want to investigate which factors can
influence the length of the frogs. It is told that the species benefits from holes in the cloud forest’s
canopy or shrub layers. Because the holes allow sunlight to reach and warm up the ground floor of
the forests which is helpful for this particular species. These holes, especially those in the canopy,
can exist naturally but are appearing in increasing numbers due to human activities.

A biologist studies this species in Kenya and has investigated a large number of sites in three forests
(Ngangao South, Ngangao North, and Chawia). She searched in randomly selected patches and
examined the found one in her field lab to get related variables. The goal of this project is to build a
model of 𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ as a function of the other variables she collected in the dataset. We expect to find
the model which can predict the Length well and satisfy the assumptions of the model.
